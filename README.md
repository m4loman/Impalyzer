Impedance (spectrum) analyzer for microelectrodes based on AD5933

This is a simple impedance spectrum analyzer. The design (especially the oscillator and the analog frontend) is specifically tuned to the analysis of microelectrodes used in electrophysiology. Even though the AD5933 comes with its own signal generator on board, it needs to be clock divided to perform excitation frequencies of around 1000Hz properly.

I need to add a bypass circuit in the next revision for electroplating but hey.. this is a good start
